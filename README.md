### Spellbook
This is a small project I decided to write after playing DnD 5e via Roll20. 
I play a wizard, which means I have a lot of spells to keep track of. 
Unfortunatley, Roll20's spellbook isn't the best to browse since it is basically a form.
This is meant to be a tool for me to keep track of things like what spells I actually have prepared, and what my character is currently concentrating on.

## Running
- Install dependencies via `yarn install`
- Run using `yarn start`

## Customize for your own use
The spellbook is currently hard-coded in Spellbook.tsx, but I plan on moving it at some point.
It'll probably live in a json file at some point. Replace the contents with your own spell stats and everything should just work (tm)
